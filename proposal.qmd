description: "Our team is participating in a Kaggle Competition with the the objective being to create a model capable of identifying personally identifiable information (PII) within student writing. The existence of PII poses a formidable barrier to the analysis and creation of openly accessible datasets aimed at advancing education, as making such data publicly available exposes students to potential risks. To mitigate these risks, it is imperative to thoroughly screen and cleanse educational data of any PII prior to its public release, a process that could be optimized and facilitated through the application of data science techniques."

## Dataset

Our dataset comes from the Kaggle competition we are competeing in, and it consists of around 22,000 essays submitted by students, all of which were written in response to a single assignment prompt, which required students to apply course concepts to a real-world scenario. We selected this dataset/competition because certain team members possess experience in NLP tasks, and it presents an opportunity to impart new skills to the rest of the team while tackling a tangible problem aligned with Kaggle's objective of detecting personally identifiable information (PII) within these essays. 

To safeguard student privacy, original PII in the dataset has been substituted with surrogate identifiers of similar types using a partially automated procedure. 70% of essays have been set aside for the test set, resulting in our team using other datasets to supplement our work for this project. (Supplemental dataset search is in progress). 

The competition data is provided in JSON format, containing various components such as a document identifier, the complete essay text, a token list, details about whitespace, and token annotations. The documents underwent tokenization using the SpaCy English tokenizer. 

Token labels adhere to the BIO (Beginning, Inner, Outer) format. When a token represents the start of a personally identifiable information (PII) entity, its type is prefixed with "B-". For tokens that continue an entity, they are prefixed with "I-". Tokens that do not pertain to PII are labeled as "O".

## Questions

1. Can we develop a model that successfully detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing?
2. How can we evaluate the model's performance effectively? Which metrics are most appropriate for PII detection tasks?
