## Introduction {.smaller}

-   Our team is participating in a Kaggle competition in which the primary goal is to develop a model capable of detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing.
-   Our task focuses on word-level classification, where each word in a text belongs to one of several predefined categories, akin to a multiclass classification problem. This approach is commonly known as ‘Named Entity Recognition’. 
-   Our process involved creating and running three DeBERTa models of various sizes (extra small, small, and large) to solve the Kaggle objective, while being able to compare our three models and determine which one works best.


## Our Questions to Solve

-   Can we develop a model that successfully detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing?
-   How can we evaluate the model’s performance effectively? Which metrics are most appropriate for PII detection tasks?


## Dataset {.smaller}

-   Approximately 22,000 student essays, with each essay responding to a single assignment prompt, where each word in a text is assigned to one of 13 predefined labels. 
-   The key variables in the dataset include tokens representing simplified word forms, each associated with these labels.
-    Each label can be prefaced by either B (beginning) or I (inner), which is a way to tell whether a token is the first word of an entity or its continuation. The majority of tokens are labelled as “O”, (outer) meaning they do not constitute PII.
-   Preprocessing: The text is tokenized using DeBERTa’s tokenizer to ensure that named entities are correctly identified and segmented.


## Model 1: Extra Small DeBERTa

-   Configuration: DeBERTa-v3 Extra Small - a 70.68 Million parameter model.
-   Training Details: Tuned with a smaller batch size due to resource constraints, focusing on maximizing model efficiency.
-   Expected Advantage: Lower computational requirements, making it suitable for environments with strict resource limitations.

## Model 2: Small DeBERTa

-   Configuration: DeBERTa-v3 Small - a 141.30 Million parameter model.
-   Training Details: Balance between computational demand and performance, using a moderate batch size and learning rate.
-   Expected Advantage: Expected to perform better than the extra small model with manageable resource use.

## Model 3: Large DeBERTa

-   Configuration: DeBERTa-v3 Large - a 434.01 Million parameter model
-   Training Details: Utilizes larger batch sizes and more extended training periods to exploit the model’s capacity fully.
-   Expected Advantage: Highest accuracy and performance, suitable for scenarios where computational resources are less of a constraint.

## Results 

-   The Extra Small DeBERTa model offers the fastest inference time but at the cost of lower F5 score.
-   The Small DeBERTa model provides a balanced performance with reasonable inference times and improved F5 Score over the extra small variant.
-   The Large DeBERTa model achieves the highest F5 score, reflecting its larger model capacity and outperformance.
